### How does Karang work?

## Karang aims to overcome the funding and coordination obstacles that prevent access to data and analysis. Making an informed decision shouldn't be dependent budgets or FTEs.

## Here's how it would work for YOU:

With Karang's technology...
- Ownership remains with the data creator.
- Transactions are direct between beneficiaries and producers.
- Exchanges are secure & confidential, yet traceable.
- Members specify their own terms & conditions for participation. An exchange won't occur unless it meets your requirements.

## Here's how it works for us:
We form a digital network of data/analysis producers and beneficiaries (that's YOU!).
Network members describe their needs/services, and these descriptions enable Karang to meet these needs by pooling and connecting resources within the network.
Similar data/analysis is pooled to satisfy (a) particular beneficiary(ies), while payments for similar data/analysis are also pooled to finance this data creation/analysis.
The technology Karang uses allows this network to form an infinte number of ever-changing channels to satisfy any and every unique need.

## And here's what we're doing behind the scenes:
