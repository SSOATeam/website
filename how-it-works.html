	<h3>What is the purpose of the Karang marketplace?</h3>

	<p>
		Karang connects producers and beneficiaries of interrelated coastal data and analytics.
		In each use-case, Karang members specifically describe their resources or requirements in a smart
		survey form. Then, our specialized algorithms detect and connect overlapping regions of our network.
		This is revolutionary, because it helps our clients overcome financial and logistical barriers that
		otherwise inhibit market participation.
	</p>

	<p>
		With the Karang platform, you are guaranteed secure and confidential exchanges matching your exact
		specifications. We pool similar data and analysis to satisfy particular beneficiaries, while pooling
		payments to finance this data creation or analysis. Karang's ecosystem can accomodate an infinte
		number of ever-changing channels satisfying emergent needs.
	</p>
	<h3>So, what does this mean for me as a client?</h3>
	<p>
		- Ownership remains with the data creator.
		<br>
		- Transactions are direct between beneficiaries and producers.
		<br>
		- Exchanges are secure and confidential, yet traceable.
		<br>
		- Members specify their own terms and conditions for participation.
		<br>
		- An exchange won't occur unless it meets your requirements.
	</p>
