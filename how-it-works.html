	Karang facilitates direct, traceable, and secure transactions between buyers and
	sellers of data and analysis, forming a distributed network of digital connections
	within coastal communities and the seafood industry. These information buyers and
	sellers specify their needs or offerings, as well as associated terms and conditions
	within digital “smart contracts.” Then, Karang's algorithms use these specifications
	to identify overlapping needs/offerings, executing secure and direct information
	exchanges whenever there is a match. This matching process effectively pools demand
	for, and supply of, information to achieve economies of scale from within and beyond
	individual communities.
	<br>
	<br>KARANG’S DECENTRALIZED NETWORK</br>
	Every information seller and buyer is a node within Karang’s ever-expanding network.
	Karang’s digital infrastructure connects these nodes together, transmitting information
	and compensation according to terms and conditions specified within smart contracts.
	<br>
	<br>KARANG’S SMART CONTRACTS</br>
	Information sellers and buyers interact with the Karang network via “smart contracts”
	-- bits of computer code that automatically execute whenever certain pre-specified
	conditions are met. Each buyer/seller has unique smart contracts that specify their
	information needs or offerings. The Karang team can provide smart contract templates
	and other smart contract assistance.
	<br>
	<br>KARANG’S ALGORITHMS</br>
	Our specialized algorithms use smart contract specifications to match buyers to
	sellers, pooling relevant information to meet buyers’ requests, and payments for the
	sellers who generate this information. Karang algorithms perpetually form and reform
	these pools based on network participants, adapting to ever-changing supply and demand.
	This revolutionary approach enables clients to bypass financial and logistical barriers
	to critical information.
	<br>
	<br>SO, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ME AS A CLIENT?</br>
	- Exchanges are guaranteed to match your unique specifications for every use-case because
	YOU specify your terms and conditions.
	- No exchange of funds or information access will be granted until the terms and conditions you laid out are met.
	- Transactions are direct between buyers and sellers; no middlemen.
	- Transactions are secure and confidential, yet traceable.
	- Information discovery or finding information buyers is no longer a laborious, time-consuming process. It’s completely automated.<br>

<!-- 	<h3>What is the purpose of the Karang marketplace?</h3>

	<p>
		Karang connects producers and beneficiaries of interrelated coastal data and analytics.
		In each use-case, Karang members specifically describe their resources or requirements in a smart
		survey form. Then, our specialized algorithms detect and connect overlapping regions of our network.
		This is revolutionary, because it helps our clients overcome financial and logistical barriers that
		otherwise inhibit market participation.
	</p>

	<p>
		With the Karang platform, you are guaranteed secure and confidential exchanges matching your exact
		specifications. We pool similar data and analysis to satisfy particular beneficiaries, while pooling
		payments to finance this data creation or analysis. Karang's dynamic ecosystem can accomodate ever-changing
		channels of supply and demand.
	</p>
	<h3>So, what does this mean for me as a client?</h3>
	<p>
		- Ownership remains with the data creator.
		<br>
		- Transactions are direct between beneficiaries and producers.
		<br>
		- Exchanges are secure and confidential, yet traceable.
		<br>
		- Members specify their own terms and conditions for participation.
		<br>
		- An exchange won't occur unless it meets your requirements.
