	Karang connects providers and beneficiaries of interrelated coastal data and analytics.
		
	<br>KARANG’S DECENTRALIZED NETWORK</br>
	Every data provider and beneficiary is a node within Karang’s ever-expanding network.
	Karang’s digital infrastructure forms the network’s highways that connect these nodes 
	together. Data, analysis, and/or compensation flows along these highways.
		
	<br>KARANG’S SMART CONTRACTS</br>
	Data providers and beneficiaries interact with the Karang network via smart contracts, 
	little bits of computer code that automatically execute whenever certain pre-specified 
	conditions are met. Each provider/beneficiary has (a) smart contract(s) that specifies 
	their unique data/analytics resources or requirements. Karang has surveys and offers
	build assistance that walk through the construction process for these smart contracts.
	
	<br>KARANG’S ALGORITHMS</br>
	Our specialized algorithms use the information specified in the smart contracts to 
	detect and connect overlaps within our network. This pools similar data/analysis to 
	satisfy particular beneficiaries, and forms payment pools that finance the 
	generation of this data/analysis by providers. This is revolutionary, because it 
	enables our clients to overcome financial and logistical barriers that would 
	otherwise inhibit their ability to access or produce data/analysis. And because our 
	algorithms are constantly running, these pools are being perpetually formed and re-
	formed, adapting to keep up with ever-changing supply and demand.

	<br>SO, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ME AS A CLIENT?</br>
	- Exchanges are guaranteed to match your unique specifications for every use-case 
	because YOU specify your terms and conditions.<br>
	- No exchange of fund, no access to data/analysis will be granted until the terms 
	and conditions you laid out are met.<br>
	- Data/analysis ownership remains with the creator/analyst. Only access is granted.<br>
	- Transactions are direct between beneficiaries and providers; no middlemen. <br>
	- Transactions are secure and confidential, yet traceable.<br>
	- Data/analysis discovery or finding buyers for your data/services is no longer a 
	laborious, time-consuming process. It’s completely automated. With Karang, you 
	don’t need to do anything, we handle it all!<br>

<!-- 	<h3>What is the purpose of the Karang marketplace?</h3>

	<p>
		Karang connects producers and beneficiaries of interrelated coastal data and analytics.
		In each use-case, Karang members specifically describe their resources or requirements in a smart
		survey form. Then, our specialized algorithms detect and connect overlapping regions of our network.
		This is revolutionary, because it helps our clients overcome financial and logistical barriers that
		otherwise inhibit market participation.
	</p>

	<p>
		With the Karang platform, you are guaranteed secure and confidential exchanges matching your exact
		specifications. We pool similar data and analysis to satisfy particular beneficiaries, while pooling
		payments to finance this data creation or analysis. Karang's dynamic ecosystem can accomodate ever-changing
