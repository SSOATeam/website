	<h4 id="-karang-means-coral-in-indonesian-">“Karang” means “coral” in Indonesian.</h4>
	<p>
		Sure, many of Karang’s primary use-cases are centered around corals (e.g., aquatic monitoring and natural asset insurance)... and yes,
		plenty of our pilot projects and team members are located in Southeast Asia, but our name actually captures how Karang works, 
		and what we aim to achieve.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ecologists consider corals to be "foundational species", they support a plethora of processes and organisms required to create and maintain 
		an ecosystem. Similarly, Karang aims to support a thriving coastal economy, to foster continuous innovation in a sea of ever-changing information.
	</p>
	<p>
		Corals reproduce and colonize new areas by spawning, that is, releasing their larvae into the water to be distributed by currents. Likewise,
		Karang aggregates dilute supply and demand of data/analysis, then optimally distributes these resources along with compensation. This facilitates
		symbiotic, self-perpetuating value exchanges between network members, ultimately driving holistic, sustainable coastal solutions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like corals, we cannot exist in isolation - Karang is an ecosystem for government agencies, researchers, citizens, and more. 
		We invite you to join us!
