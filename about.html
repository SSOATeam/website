	<h4 id="-karang-means-coral-in-indonesian-">“Karang” means “coral” in Indonesian.</h4>
	<p>Corals encapsulate many of the core concepts of our business. Yes, several of Karang’s initial use-cases are
		centered around corals (like aquatic monitoring and natural asset insurance), and yes, many of our pilot
		projects and team members are located in Southeast Asia, but there&#39;s a lot more to this name.</p>
	<p>Corals are foundation species. They support all sorts of processes and organisms critical to maintaining an
		ecosystem. Without corals, the whole system collapses.</p>

		Similarly, Karang as a business aims to support a thriving coastal economy, forming a foundation of
		ever-changing information that fosters continual innovation.</h3>
	<p>Corals are also colonial organisms. Teeny-tiny individual coral polyps aggregate together to form the reefs we
		all know. Corals do not survive on their own, but together within a community.</p>

		Similarly, Karang is the threads connecting its nodes together in our network. Karang does not exist in
		isolation, but within the community of coastal businesses, NGOs, government agencies, researchers, and citizens.
	</h3>
	<p>The coral life cycle has phases of aggregation (forming reefs) and distribution. Corals reproduce by spawning,
		releasing their larvae into the water to be distributed around by currents to settle and colonize new areas.</p>

		Similarly, Karang aggregates dilute demand for, and supply of, data/analysis, then distributes this
		data/analysis along with compensation. We enable a self-perpetuating cycle of value exchange, data/analysis and
		compensation constantly flowing between network members to generate innovation and holistic, long-term coastal
		solutions.</h3>
