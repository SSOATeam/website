	<h4 id="-karang-means-coral-in-indonesian-">“Karang” means “coral” in Indonesian.</h4>
	<p>
		Sure, many of Karang’s primary use-cases are centered around corals (e.g., aquatic monitoring and natural asset insurance)... and yes,
		plenty of our pilot projects and team members are located in Southeast Asia... but, there is so much more depth of significance in our name.
	</p>
	<p>
		Coral reefs are colonial organisms made up of microscopic polyps - they are a foundation species supporting a plethora of processes and organisms
		required to create and maintain an ecosystem. Similarly, Karang aims to support a thriving coastal economy, to foster continuous innovation
		in a sea of ever-changing information.
	</p>
	<p>
		Corals reproduce and colonize new areas by spawning, that is, releasing their larvae into the water to be distributed by currents. Likewise,
		Karang aggregates dilute supply and demand of data/analysis, then finds the optimal way to distribute these resources and obtain compensation.
		This facilitates symbiotic, self-perpetuating value exchanges between network members, ultimately driving holistic, sustainable coastal solutions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like corals, we cannot exist in isolation - Karang is an ecosystem for coastal businesses, NGOs, government agencies, researchers, and citizens.
		We hope you join us!
